# FirebaseAuthenticationBundle
A lightweight, self-contained, zero-dependency, spec-compliant Symfony bundle providing authentication with Firebase JWT out of the box.

## Installation
Install this bundle with Composer:
```shell
composer require danieleambrosino/firebase-authentication-bundle
```

## Configuration
Set is your Firebase project's ID in the `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` environment variable:

```env
# .env
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

Add the `firebase` authenticator to any of your app's firewall:

```yaml
# config/packages/security.yaml
security:
    firewalls:
        main:
            stateless: true
            firebase: ~
```

For each firewall you can select the authentication `strategy` (default is `bearer`):
- with the `bearer` strategy, your requests must be authenticated sending the *ID token* (generated by the Auth package of the Firebase client SDK you're using) into an `Authorization: Bearer` HTTP header (accordingly to [the OAuth 2.0 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-2.1));
- with the `cookie` strategy, your requests must be authenticated sending the *session cookie token* as a cookie, named accordingly to the `cookie_name` parameter (default is `sessionToken`).

That's it! The authenticated user will be identified using the claim in the JWT payload specified by the `user_identifier` parameter (default is `sub`).

You can require that the email is verified by setting on a per-firewall basis the `verify_email` boolean parameter.
Optionally, you can add a `leeway` global parameter (as a positive integer number of seconds) to account for clock skew with Google's servers.

This bundle also provides a very basic user provider for special purposes (e.g. securing the registration route).

## Configuration reference

```yaml
# config/packages/firebase_authentication.yaml
firebase_authentication:
    project_id:      '%env(string:FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID)%'

    # The leeway to account for clock skew with Google servers
    leeway:          0

    # Used only by the authenticators with "cookie" strategy
    cookie_name:     sessionToken

    # The field in the payload used to identify the user
    user_identifier: sub
```

```yaml
# config/packages/security.yaml
security:
	providers:
		jwt: { firebase: null }
	firewalls:
		main:
			stateless: true
			firebase:
				strategy:     bearer # One of "bearer"; "cookie"
				verify_email: false
```
